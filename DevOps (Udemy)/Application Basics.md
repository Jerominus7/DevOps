## Types of Languages  
  
### Compiled  
#### Steps:  
##### Developed  
  
filename:  
**MyClass.java**  
code:  
`public class MyClass {`  
`public static void main(String[] args) {`  
`System.out.println("Hello World!");`  
`}`  
`}`  
##### Compiled  
command:  
`javac MyClass.java`  
outputs this file:  
**MyClass.class**  
##### Executed  
command:  
`java Myclass`  
outputs:  
**Hello World!**  
  
  
  
##### Â Samples  
Java  
C  
C++  
  
First written, then compiled into machine language, and then executed.  
Only works on the platform it was designed for.  
  
  
  
### Interpreted  
#### Steps:  
##### Develop Source Code  
filename:  
**main.py**  
code:  
`def print_message():`  
`print("Hello World")`  
`if __name__ == '__main__':'  
`print_message()`  
  
#### Execute/Run Code  
code:  
`python main.py`  
output:  
**Hello World**  
  
A compiler translates human readable code to machine code.  
  
Note: Just because Python doesn't compile, it doesn't mean the code doesn't get translated into bytecode and then again into machine code.  
  
main.py (human code) -> main.pyc ( intermediary byte code) -> machine code  
  
  
**human code -> compiler -> intermediary byte code -> interpreter (executes inside the python vm) -> machine code**  
  
So with the python VM interpreter, can be ran on different machines, as long as it exists.  
  
All of this happens in the background when you run Python
